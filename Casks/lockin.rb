  caveats <<~EOS
    LockIn installs a privileged background helper to enforce blocks across all
    browsers and survive reboot. On first launch you'll be asked to approve it in
    System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions.

    Because it installs a root daemon and a per-user agent, the regular
    `brew uninstall lockin` cannot remove those system files. Open LockIn and use
    Settings → Uninstall (only available when no lock is active) BEFORE removing
    the app, then run `brew uninstall lockin`.
